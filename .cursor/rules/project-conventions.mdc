# Word of the Day – Agent Rules

## Project overview

- **Stack**: Flutter (Dart SDK >=3.3), Material 3, `shared_preferences`, `http`.
- **App**: Single main screen showing a “word of the day” with share and favorite (placeholders).
- **Assets**: Word data lives under `assets/data/`; app icon/splash under `assets/icon/`.

## Code structure

- **Entry**: `lib/main.dart` – sets up `MaterialApp`, theme (indigo seed, light/dark), and `WordOfTheDayScreen`.
- **Screens**: `lib/screens/` – UI screens (e.g. `WordOfTheDayScreen`).
- **Data**: `lib/data/` – sample/curated word data and types.
- **Services**: `lib/services/` – e.g. `WordSelectionService` for selecting today’s word.
- **Tools**: `tool/` – CLI/scripts (e.g. `generate_curated_words.dart`) for generating or processing data; run with `dart run`, not as app code.

## Conventions for agents

1. **Dart/Flutter**
   - Prefer `const` constructors and `final` where possible.
   - Use existing `flutter_lints`; avoid disabling lints without a short comment.
   - Keep widget trees readable; extract sub-widgets or methods when they get long.

2. **Theming**
   - Use the app’s existing `ThemeData` / `ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: 0xFF6366F1)`; don’t introduce new global colors unless the user asks.

3. **Data and services**
   - Word content should flow from `lib/data/` or `assets/data/` through services (e.g. `WordSelectionService`); don’t hardcode large word lists in UI code.
   - Changes to word data format should be reflected in both app code and any `tool/` scripts that produce that data.

4. **Scope**
   - When adding features, match the current structure (screens, services, data) and avoid unnecessary new dependencies in `pubspec.yaml` unless the user requests them.

5. **Platform**
   - iOS and Android are in use; if you add native or plugin behavior, consider both platforms.
