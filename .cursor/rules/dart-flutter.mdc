# Dart & Flutter Standards

## Style and correctness

- Use `const` constructors and `final` variables wherever possible.
- Prefer `super.key` and `super.parameters` in widget constructors.
- Follow existing `flutter_lints`; do not disable lints without a brief justification in a comment.

## Widgets and UI

- Prefer stateless widgets unless state is needed; extract stateful logic into small, focused widgets or controllers.
- Keep `build` methods readable: extract large subtrees into named widgets or private methods in the same file.
- Use the app theme (`Theme.of(context)`, `ThemeData`) instead of hardcoded colors or text styles.

## Async and errors

- Use `async`/`await`; avoid raw `.then()` for sequential logic.
- Handle errors explicitly (e.g. `try/catch`, `Result`-style types, or user-visible messages); avoid swallowing exceptions.

## Tool scripts

- Code in `tool/` is run with `dart run` (e.g. `dart run tool/generate_curated_words.dart`). Do not assume it runs inside the Flutter app runtime.
